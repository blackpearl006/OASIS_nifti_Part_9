# OASIS_nifti_Part_9

![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/75/?title=Progress&width=150&color=brightgreen)

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the first part of the OASIS-1 dataset, which comprises cross-sectional MRI data of young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. The original data was provided in the .img and .hdr formats, but I have converted it into the compressed NIfTI format (.nii.gz) using FSL_UTILS.

## About the OASIS-1 Dataset
- **Subjects**: 416
- **MR Sessions**: 434
- **Age Range**: 18 to 96
- **Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**: The dataset includes 100 subjects over the age of 60 who have been diagnosed with very mild to mild AD.
- **Additional Scans**: For 20 of the nondemented subjects, images from a subsequent scan session after a short delay (less than 90 days) are included to assess acquisition reliability.
- **Data Anonymization**: All data have been anonymized to facilitate public distribution. Facial features were removed at the fMRIDC using the Brain Extraction Tool.

## Dataset Details
- **Authors' Paper**: [Link to the paper](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/19/9/1498/4427/Open-Access-Series-of-Imaging-Studies-OASIS-Cross)
- **CSV File**: The dataset also includes an additional CSV file with information about each subject, including ID, Sex, Hand, Age, Education, SES, MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV, ASF, and Delay.

## Dataset Organization
The OASIS-1 dataset is a comprehensive medical dataset of nearly 450 patients' brain MRIs. Each patient's MRI data was conducted in 3-4 sessions, and environmental conditions and other crucial factors for diagnosis were specified. Some patients initially diagnosed as non-demented had another scan and were subsequently diagnosed with dementia.

## Dataset Visualization
I have chosen to present the OASIS-1 dataset in 12 parts, each available in a compressed .tar format, with each part being nearly 10 GB in size. I visualized the data using MRICron to ensure its accuracy and quality.

## Note
Converting the MRI images into the NIfTI format has been an exhaustive process, but I'm thrilled to provide this valuable resource for research and analysis. Stay tuned for the remaining parts of the dataset, which I'll be uploading soon.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to explore the data and provide feedback or collaborate on further research.
